            <h1>Hi, I'm Maahir Jain <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></h1> 

           <p>I'm a second-year student majoring in computer science at <span class="gt">Georgia Tech</span>.</p>

           <p>Since I began my journey with software creation, I've realized the incredible impact technology can have on people's lives. In high school, I worked on an app which made education more accessible for over a hundred students in underdeveloped regions. Since then, I've developed educational tools like <a href="https://maahirjain.github.io/matrix-viz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MatrixViz</a>, with the goal of integrating education and technology. I hope to continue the same on a larger scale by refining my technical abilities and connecting with like-minded people.</p>

           <p>To know more about me, check out <a href="https://maahirjain.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my website</a>.</p>
